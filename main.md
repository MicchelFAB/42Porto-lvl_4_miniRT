# MiniRT

## Project Synopsis

**MiniRT** is a lightweight and efficient ray tracing project designed for both educational purposes and practical applications. It aims to provide a simple yet powerful framework for understanding and implementing ray tracing algorithms.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of MiniRT is to demonstrate the core concepts and techniques of ray tracing in computer graphics. It serves as a foundational tool for students, educators, and developers who are interested in exploring the intricacies of rendering scenes with realistic lighting and shadows.

### Key Features

- Basic and advanced ray tracing techniques
- Support for various geometric primitives (spheres, planes, etc.)
- Realistic shading models and lighting calculations
- Extensible architecture for adding new features and optimizations
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Intended Audience

MiniRT is intended for:
- Students and educators in computer graphics and related fields
- Developers looking to understand or experiment with ray tracing
- Enthusiasts and hobbyists interested in learning about rendering techniques

### Usage

MiniRT can be used as a standalone application for rendering scenes or as a library integrated into larger graphics projects. It provides a clear and concise API for defining scenes, materials, and lights, making it easy to get started with ray tracing.
